# MicrochannelsBoiling
Microchannels boiling database (data from open papers)

The idea of this database appeared in 2014 when I was working on my Ph.D. The database was started in Aug.2020 with a blessing of Aleksandr Lavrikov.

All the data for this dataset is taken from open sources (papers, reports etc.). It is open for use with relevant links to sources and this dataset.

Good luck!
