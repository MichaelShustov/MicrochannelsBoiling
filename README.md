# MicrochannelsBoiling
Microchannels boiling database (data from open papers)

The idea of this database appeared in 2014, when I was working on my Ph.D.
I think that all the experimental papers written since Newton times must be formalized and placed to such datasets. 

All the data for this dataset is taken from open sources (papers, reports etc.). It is open for use with relevant links to sources and this dataset.

Good luck!
